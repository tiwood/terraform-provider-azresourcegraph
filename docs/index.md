# azresourcegraph Provider

This provider allows you to query [Azure Resource Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview)
and use the results together with other `Terraform` providers.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Authentication using Client Credentials
provider "azresourcegraph" {
  tenant_id     = var.tenant_id
  client_id     = var.client_id
  client_secret = var.client_secret
}

# Authentication using Azure Default Credential
# 1. Environment Variables
# 2. Managed Identity
# 3. Azure CLI
# 4. Azure Developer CLI
provider "azresourcegraph" {
  use_azure_default_credential = true
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `client_id` (String) The Client ID which should be used. This can also be sourced from the `AZRGRAPH_CLIENT_ID` Environment Variable.
- `client_secret` (String, Sensitive) The Client Secret which should be used. This can also be sourced from the `AZRGRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET` Environment Variable.
- `tenant_id` (String) The Tenant ID which should be used. This can also be sourced from the `AZRGRAPH_TENANT_ID` Environment Variable.
- `use_azure_default_credential` (Boolean) Use Azure Default Credential for authentication. If this is true, the provider will try to authenticate using the following mechanisms in order:
Environment variables > Workload identity > Managed Identity > Azure CLI > Azure Developer CLI This can also be sourced from the `AZRGRAPH_USE_AZURE_DEFAULT_CREDENTIAL` Environment Variable. Defaults to true.
Note, that the Client Secret flow will take precedence over the Azure Default Credential.
