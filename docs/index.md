# azresourcegraph Provider

This provider allows you to query [Azure Resource Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview)
and use the results together with other `Terraform` providers.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "azresourcegraph" {
  tenant_id     = var.tenant_id
  client_id     = var.client_id
  client_secret = var.client_secret
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `client_id` (String) The Client ID which should be used. This can also be sourced from the `AZRGRAPH_CLIENT_ID` Environment Variable.
- `client_secret` (String, Sensitive) The Client Secret which should be used. This can also be sourced from the `AZRGRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET` Environment Variable.
- `tenant_id` (String) The Tenant ID which should be used. This can also be sourced from the `AZRGRAPH_TENANT_ID` Environment Variable.

~> **Note:** When provider attributes for `client_id`, `client_secret` or `tenant_id` are not set, the provider will fallback on using the Azure CLI token credential if it is available.
